  "name": "The Stewardship Cap",
  "description": "Steward is a volunteer position, created with the intent to separate control of the treasury (through being a signer on the Safe) from those receiving direct payouts without community oversight (Wardens). Stewards can still receive Giving Circle payouts and have a paid position on a project, because these rewards have community oversight.",
